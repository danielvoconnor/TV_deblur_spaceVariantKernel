This code accompanies the paper
"Total variation image deblurring with 
space-varying kernel", D. O'Connor, L. Vandenberghe.

The experiment of section 5.1 can be reproduced by running experiment_huber.m.

The experiment of section 5.2 can be reproduced by running experiment_2.m.

experiment_2.m uses a segmentation which was computed using 
the code that accompanies the paper
"Analyzing spatially-varying blur" by Chakrabarti, Zickler, and Freeman.
This code, and the image used in experiment_2.m, are available at
