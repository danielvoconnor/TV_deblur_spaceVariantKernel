# TV_deblur_spaceVariantKernel
This code accompanies the paper
"Total variation image deblurring with 
space-varying kernel", D. O'Connor, L. Vandenberghe.
The paper can be found here: http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/publications/

If you have any questions about this code, feel free to email daniel.v.oconnor@gmail.com.

The experiment of section 5.1 can be reproduced by running experiment_huber.m.

The experiment of section 5.2 can be reproduced by running experiment_2.m.

experiment_2.m uses a segmentation which was computed using 
the code that accompanies the paper
"Analyzing spatially-varying blur" by Chakrabarti, Zickler, and Freeman.
This code, and the image used in experiment_2.m, are available at
